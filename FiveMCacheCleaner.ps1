# This PowerShell code deletes certain folders from the specified directory if they exist. 
# It checks whether the folders ‚Äúcache‚Äù, ‚Äúserver-cache‚Äù and ‚Äúserver-cache-priv‚Äù exist in the directory ‚ÄúC:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app\data‚Äù and removes them together with their contents. 
# If folders are missing, a corresponding message is displayed.
# If FiveM is not installed on the C: hard disk, the path must be adjusted accordingly.
